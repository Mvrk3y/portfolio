                        <h3>Adapting to College Life: My Academic Journey</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-content">
                        <p> The transition from high school to college has been the most challenging experience of my life. It showed me that I was very dependent on my teachers when I was in high school. It is very hard to teach myself some of the modules because they demand experience in Computer Studies from high school, which I do not have.</p>

                        <p>The biggest adjustment was learning to manage my time effectively. Unlike high school, where teachers closely monitored our progress, college required me to take complete ownership of my learning. I struggled with procrastination and found myself preparing last minute for my tests, which led to poor performance in my first tests.</p>

                        <p>When I discovered the Pomodoro Technique a week after my tests, everything changed. Breaking my study sessions into focused 25 minute intervals with short breaks improved my productivity. I also started using digital tools like Notion to organize my assignments, deadlines and study materials. Creating a structured weekly schedule helped me balance coursework, part time tutoring, and personal time. I am now able to manage my time effectively and stay focused on my studies.</p>

                        <p>Another major adaptation was developing effective study habits. I learned that passive reading was not sufficient for my modules. Instead, I adopted active learning strategies such as creating mind maps, working through practice problems and teaching other colleagues what I know on a certain topic through peer tutoring. This approach improved my understanding of the material. It also boosted my confidence in my studies.</p>

                        <p>Looking back, I realize that struggling initially was part of the growth process. College has taught me self-discipline and the importance of asking for help from lecturers and colleagues when needed. Teaching myself some of the modules has been easy when I developed effective study habits. These skills will undoubtedly serve me well in my future career as a computer systems engineer.</p>

                    <div class="blog-header">
                        <h3>Group Work Experiences</h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-content">
                        <p>Our recent group  Consultancy Team Project provided an excellent opportunity to experience Tuckman's stages of group development firsthand. As a team of six Computer Systems Engineering students, we navigated through each stage, learning valuable lessons about collaboration.</p>

                        <p><strong>Forming:</strong> This stage was the easiest when we formed our group because we already knew each other from high school and we already knew each other's strengths. We spent our first meeting discussing the project requirements. We avoided addressing potential conflicts or establishing clear roles. This stage felt comfortable, as we focused more on being agreeable.</p>

                        <p><strong>Storming:</strong> By the second week, some members were absent when we were supposed to meet and tackle the group project. Some members felt like their answers were the only ones correct hence conflicts arose. Some members were quiet and some team members were natural leaders who wanted to take charge, while others preferred to follow instructions. This stage was uncomfortable but necessary for establishing our working dynamics.</p>

                        <p><strong>Norming:</strong> After addressing our misunderstandings through open discussion, we established clear roles based on individual strengths. I took responsibility for the chairperson role, while others focused on research and project documentation. We set deadlines for each member so that we can finish the project on time.</p>

                        <p><strong>Performing:</strong> Once our roles were established, the group work began to be productive. We worked well with each other, sharing knowledge and learning some skills from each other. Decisions were made quickly, and we supported each other through challenges. The final weeks of the project demonstrated true teamwork, with perfect collaboration and shared ownership of our success.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Adjourning:</strong> As we completed our presentation and submitted the final report, there was a sense of accomplishment. We reflected on our journey and exchanged contact information, recognizing the valuable relationships we had built. This experience taught me that effective teamwork requires patience, communication, and mutual respect to build a strong foundation for success.</p> <p>These experiences have equipped me with the skills essential for any engineering career.</p>
